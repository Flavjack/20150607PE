["abstract.html", "Abstract", " Abstract Jatropha curcas is an important specie for production of bio fuel. The specie can survive and produce fruits and seeds even in drought condition. For an adequate establishment in the field is necessary that seeds have good quality in vigor and viability. In this study, we evaluated the seed water relation with different imbibition times, in deionized water, from 0 to 24 hours. Imbibed seeds were sown in polyethylene trays with 1,200 g of river sand. The germination was recorded every day for 25 days. Seeds with at least 10 mm radicle on the soil surface was considered as germinated. To determinate seed water content (SWC), 10 seeds were weighed in fresh (SFW), turgid (STW) and dry weight (SDW) at 105°C for 24 hours. Our results show a decrease in the germination rate from 85% to 47%, and an increase of the mean germination time from 4.77 to 7.05 days after 24 hours of imbibition. The initial moisture of the seed used in this experiment was about 8% and after 24 hours of imbibition the SWC was around 60%. The initial low moisture in the seeds produce imbibition damage because the tissue hydration takes place in a not controlled way so that the reconstruction of internal structures of the cells and organelles were affected. According to the PCA analysis the seed germination had a negative correlation with the imbibition time (r=-0.72, p&lt;0.05) and with the electrical conductive (r=-0.88, p&lt;0.05) related to the seed vigor. This study suggest that electrical conductivity may be useful in J. curcas for vigor test and their seeds don’t need previously water imbibition to improve germination from seeds with initial moisture less than 8%. Key words: bio fuel, seed water content, seed moisture, germinability "],
["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Jatropha curcas L. belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to the American tropics (Abhilash et al. 2010). It is a small tree but it can reach 6 meters or more. J. curcas is a seed-bearing plant and can produce 1-2 kg of seed per plant/year when the plant is 2-3 years old (Mukherjee et al. 2011) and can be propagated both by seeds and stem cuttings. More than 95% of the oil produced for biodiesel purposes comes from edible oils, which can have a negative impact on food production (khan et al. 2014). J. curcas seeds are a good source of oil and It has great economic potential as an alternative to oil bio fuel. The decorticated seeds contain 40-60% oil (Kumar et al. 2010, SHAH 2005) and is a non-edible, eco-friendly, non-toxic, biodegradable fuel-producing plant has attracted worldwide attention as an alternate sustainable energy source for the future (Mukherjee et al. 2011). The seeds of J. curcas have a short viability period and they are more sensitive to salinity at germination (Elhag y Gafar 2014, Moncaleano-Escandon et al. 2013). J. curcas is drought tolerant (Luz Costa et al. 2015) and perhaps also as salinity tolerant it can be cultivated on marginal and salt affected areas, without competing with crop food production (Elhag y Gafar 2014, Heller 1996). Seed deterioration is a natural and irreversible process, even under ideal storage conditions. Dry seeds suffer a variety of biochemical and metabolic changes, including lipid peroxidation, enzyme inactivation and rupture of cellular membranes (Bewley et al. 2012). In arid environments, the water needed for germination is available for only short periods and consequently, successful crop establishment depends not only on rapid and uniform germination of the seed, but also on the ability of the seed to germinate under low water availability (Windauer et al. 2007). The speed and uniformity of seed germination are prominent parameters especially for field crop seeds to compete with weed seeds (Ruttanaruangboworn et al. 2017). Water uptake is the fundamental requirement for the initiation and completion of seed germination (Koornneef et al. 2002). Studies on germination and seedling establishment which are the critical stages in the plant life cycle. In these important species have not been conducted so far. Knowledge of the capacity of the species to complete this stage successfully is fundamental for crop production (Windauer et al. 2011). Considerable variation was registered in J. curcas for seed germination, seedling growth and biomass parameters. The small value of error or environmental variances of the seedling growth traits suggests that majority of characters are under genetic control (Ginwal et al. 2005). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of J. curcas seeds under different imbibition time, seed water relation and aspects about germination. References "],

The seeds presented 72% viability and they were collected in 2013 and stored around 9% humidity with any pesticide treatment. 2.2 Seed imbibiton test and water relation The seeds was distributed in 52 cups (400 ml) with 25 seed for each experimental unit in a controlled room at 25 °C. For each cup was applied 100 ml deionized water according to the imbibition treatment (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 hours). The pH (W3B, Bel Engineering , Italy) and electrical conductivity (CD-4306, Lutron, Taiwan) were evaluated with 20 ml of soaking solution for each treatment. For seed water content 52 cups (100 ml) was applied 50 ml deionized water and were added 10 seed previously weight in a analytic scale (ATY224, Shimadzu, Japan) according to different imbibition time. After each treatment was take the seeds imbibition weight and putted in papers bags for oven at 104 °C for 24 hours and determinate seeds dry weight.The water relation variables were calculated according the following formulas: \\(SMT(\\%) = 1 - (S_{dw}/S_{fw})*100\\) and \\(SWC(\\%) = (S_{tw} - S_{fw})/S_{fw} *100\\). Where \\(SMT(\\%)\\), Seed moisture; \\(SWC(\\%)\\) Seed Water content; \\(S_{dw} (g)\\), Seed dry weight; \\(S_{fw} (g)\\), Seed fresh weight and \\(S_{tw} (g)\\), Seed turgid weight. 2.3 Germination test The 25 seed from each treatment was sowing in aluminium trays content 1000 g of river sand at field capacity (1300 g). The seed was distributed in the tray and covered with 200 g sand. The germination experiment was carried out in greenhouse condition with average temperature of 27.48 °C and 78.05% relative humidity. Seed germination was evaluated daily according to agronomic criteria consider germinated seed when the radicle had emerged about 1 cm above the surface of sowing media. When no germination was observed in all treatments at least in five consecutive days, the germination was considered completed (Moncaleano-Escandon et al. 2013). 2.4 Data analysis The experimental was carried out in a completely randomized design with 13 treatments of imbibition times (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 hours) with four replications with seeds of J. curcas. The germination variables was calculated according the GerminaR R package (Lozano Isla et al. 2017). Statistical analysis and generation of graphs were performed in the statistical software R (R Core Team 2017). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the differences between the factors and the comparison of the means with the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p &lt;0.05) (de Mendiburu 2017). For the multivariate analysis, correlation analysis was performed (de Mendiburu 2017, Wei y Simko 2017) and principal components analysis were made (Husson et al. 2017). References "],

The pH range had a variation from 7.7 to 5.13 showing difference between the different imbibition time with a reduction of the pH in the time (r = -0.88, p&lt;0.05), Figure 7.1 A. While the EC show a increase in relation to imbibition time (r = 0.80, p&lt;0.05) with value ranges from 0.021 to 0.69 ds.m−1, Figure 7.1 B. According the correlation analysis exits a negative correlation between EC and pH (r = -0.74, p&lt;0.05). 3.2 Seed water relation The seed moisture was 7.93% at the begging of the experiment and during the time line it arrive until 9.50% , Figure 7.1 C. The seed moisture show a strong positive correlation with the imbibition time (r = 0.89, p&lt;0.05). While the seed water content show a fast increase until the first two hour of imbibition the seed arrives to 25.67% of water content, afterwards these moment the water content in the seeds increase continuously to arrive around 59.23% in 24 hours, Figure 7.1 D. There was an increase in the water content around 6.5 times from initial moisture it is represented for a high correlation between imbibition time with the water content (r = 0.93, p&lt;0.05). While the correlation between both variables is 0.96 (p&lt;0.05). 3.3 Seed germination analisys Germinability of the seeds of Jatropha curcas had a significant decrease since the 2 hours of imbibition with a initial germinability of 85% for seed without imbibition treatment at 00 hours. After that the range of germinability were between 68 to 44% from 02 to 24 hour of imbibition (Figure 7.2 A). Germinability show a strong negative correlation with imbibition time (r = −0.72, p&lt;0.05). The mean germination time in seed without imbibiton has a major value with 4.8 day in comparative with the other treatment with values around 5.89 to 7.06 day for germination between 02 to 24 hours of imbibition (Figure 7.2 B). Seed germinability presented a negative strong correlation with a mean germination time (r = −0.88, p&lt;0.05). The germination synchrony show values from 1.86 to 2.34 without difference between the imbibition times (Figure 7.2 C). The maximum value for the uncertainty in germination for the experiment was 4.64 bits an the results don’t show any trend according the imbibition time. The germination uncertainty had values from 1.86 to 2.34 bits. The germination synchrony show a high correlation with the germination uncertainty (r = −0.92, p&lt;0.05). 3.4 Multivariate analisys The principal component analysis according to the studied variables explain 75.03% of the variance between the first and second dimension. In the first dimension exist high positive correlation between ELC (r = 0.97, p&lt;0.05), SWC (r = 0.96, p&lt;0.05), SMT (r = 0.91, p&lt;0.05), STW (r = 0.91, p&lt;0.05), IBTH (r = 0.87, p&lt;0.05), MGT (r = 0.82, p&lt;0.05) with a negative correlation with the GRP (r = -0.92, p&lt;0.05) while in the second dimension SFW (r = 0.77, p&lt;0.05), SDW (r = 0.71, p&lt;0.05) present positive correlation in contrast with HPT (r = -0.75, p&lt;0.05) with negative correlation.

["discussion.html", "4 Discussion", " 4 Discussion This study found that exist a reduction in the seed germinability of J. curcas according to water imbibiton. It is suppose that seeds precise a mount of water for promote the germination but in these case the seeds submitted to water imbibition had a decrease in germination and an increase in the mean germination time parameters related to the seed vigor (Matthews y Hosseini 2006). Also is observed during the time line of the experiment there was a increase in EC that reflect in lost the seed germinability from seed steeping in water from 02 to 24 hours. The seeds used in this experiment were stored dry and hence have very low levels of metabolism. During imbibition of water, they swell and metabolic activity increases. Hydration of tissue components during imbibition takes place in a not controlled way so that the reconstruction of internal structures of the cells and organelles was affected. So leakage of stored materials and enzymes, colouring, cracking or absence of cotyledons, and overall damage to the hypocotyl may occur during germination (Hobbs y Obendorf 1972, Pollock et al. 1969). The amount of the constituents of the leaked depended unequivocally on the initial water content of seeds; the lower moisture in seed at the initial water content show more leakage that no occur with seeds with the initial water content of 24.2% (ISHIDA et al. 1988). This damage takes place in the early stages of imbibition (Parrish y Leopold 1977). This indicates that membrane functions are restored, even though the activities of respiration and metabolism are restricted. Water molecules are semi bound and that mobile water necessary for metabolism is deficient for moisture contents between 12-24% (Koizumi et al. 2008). According to these the lost of viability can be explain for the initial seed water content of the seeds used in these experiment because they had an initial moisture around 8%. It is low water content according to moisture in harvest that is around 18% (Pompelli et al. 2010). Also in other crops like soybean seeds water content is usually 10 to 20% at harvest and falls further during storage, seed water contents below 10% were shown to be desirable for long period storage because seeds stop their biological activities and the stored materials are consumed at a minimum level (Windauer et al. 2007). J. curcas seeds after 24 hour of imbibition arrive 6.5 times initial moisture as reported by (ISHIDA et al. 1988), dried seeds is elevated to a certain level, two or three times the dry weight of seeds, and this rapid increase of water is often accompanied by some deterioration of the tissues, called imbibitional damage. These damage is expressed as a reduced rate of germination and reduced yield of surviving plants. It can be the reason in decrease in the germination percentage in these research. It was reported that soybean seeds with the water content below 13% suffered seriously from imbibitional damage while those above 17% did not, where respiration and metabolic activity rapidly increase with the increase of moisture content (ISHIDA et al. 1988, Vertucci y Leopold 1984). Imbibition damage results from the rapid entry of water into the cotyledons during imbibition, leading to cell death and high solute leakage from the seeds (POWELL y MATTHEWS 1978) and the extensive loss of cellular material and enzymes from the seeds (Duke y Kakefuda 1981, POWELL y MATTHEWS 1981) indicates extensive membrane disruption. The electrical conductivity was related with seed water content and the germination for these reason EC tests has been applied to detect vigor differences in many other grain legumes and indeed some other species (Hampton y TeKRONY 1995). The conductivity will increase as the laboratory germination falls, in addition to the reduced ability of germination seeds to retain cell contents (Matthews y Powell 2006). In many reports on peas, the EC readings for lots have been found to relate significantly to field emergence (POWELL y MATTHEWS 1981, THORNTON et al. 1990). To alleviate of the effects of soaking injury as a result of the increase in the moisture content of seeds before imbibition is related to the reduced binding energy of water molecules and the appearance of respiratory activity (Vertucci y Leopold 1984). Slow and controlled hydration is essential as the first step in the reactivation of metabolic processes in the dry seed,leading to germination and growth. The EC would be developed and standardized for these species (Abdullah et al. 1991, Yaklich y Kulik 1979, POWELL et al. 1986). Furthermore was reported than the relationship between field emergence and EC turned out to be not only interesting, but useful in practical seed technology (Matthews y Bradnock 1967) as present in these work for J. curcas.

["conclusions.html", "5 Conclusions", " 5 Conclusions The initial water content in J. curcas seeds should be consider because It will be alter the seed germinability according to the imbibition time. The measurement of EC could be have a role alongside ageing based vigor tests, like the accelerated ageing and controlled deterioration tests, by giving a measure of viability following ageing in 24 hours in place of a germination test around 15 to 30 days or longer in J. curcas.
