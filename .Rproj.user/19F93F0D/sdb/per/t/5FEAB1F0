Is suppose that seed precise a mount of water for initiation of the germination but in these case the seeds summit a soaking have a decrease in germination and increase en mean germination time. It can be explain for the initial seed water content because seeds used in these experiment have a initial moisture around 8% low water content according to moisture in harvest is around 18 % (Pompelli et al., 2010) also in other crops like soybean seeds is usually 10 to 20% at harvest and falls further during storage, Water contents below 10% were shown to be desirable for long period storage because seeds stop their biological activities and the stored materials are consumed at a minimum level [@Windauer2007Hydrotime].\n\n*J. Curcas* seed after 24 hour of imbition arrive 6.5 times initial moisture as reported by Ishida et al. (1988) [@ISHIDA1988relationship], dried seeds is elevated to a certain level, two or three times the dry weight of seeds, and this rapid increase of water is often accompanied by some deterioration of the tissues, called imbibitional damage. Since the damage is expressed as a reduced rate of germination and reduced yield of surviving plants. It can be the reason in decrease in the germination percentage in these research. It was reported that soybean seeds with the water content below 13% suffered seriously from imbibitional damage while those above 17% did no, where respiration and metabolic activity rapidly increase with the increase of moisture content [@ISHIDA1988relationship; @Vertucci1984Bound].\n\nThe seeds used in these experiment were stored dry and hence have very low levels of metabolism. During imbibition of water, they swell and metabolic activity increases. Hydration of tissue components during imbibition takes place in a not controlled way so that the reconstruction of internal structures of the cells and organelles was affected. Leakage of stored materials and enzymes, colouring, cracking or absence of cotyledons, and overall damage to the hypocotyl may occur during germination [@Hobbs1972Interaction; @pollock1969vigor]. This damage takes place in the early stages of imbibition [@Parrish1977Transient] steeping in water. This indicates that membrane functions are restored, even though the activities of respiration and metabolism are restricted. Water molecules are semi bound and that mobile water necessary for metabolism is deficient for moisture contents between 12-24% [@Koizumi2008Role].\n\nAlso is observed during the time line of the experiment there is a increase in EC that reflect in lost the viability of the seed and it does not present difference since 02 a 24 hours in the germination. The amount of these constituents leaked depended unequivocally on the initial water content of seeds; the lower moisture in seed at the initial water content show more leakage that no occur with seeds with the initial water content of 24.2% [@ISHIDA1988relationship]. The electrical conductivity were related with seed water content and the germination for these reason EC tests have also been applied to detect vigor differences in many other grain legumes and indeed some other species [@hampton1995handbook]. The methods would be developed and standardized for these species [@Abdullah1991Association; @Yaklich1979Evaluation; @POWELL1986Role].In many reports on peas, the EC readings for lots have been found to relate significantly to field emergence [@POWELL1981Physical].The conductivity will increase as the laboratory germination falls, in addition to the reduced ability of germination seeds to retain cell contents [@matthews2006electrical].Imbibition damage results from the rapid entry of water into the cotyledons during imbibition, leading to cell death and high solute leakage from the seeds [@POWELL1978Damaging]. the extensive loss of cellular material and enzymes from the seeds [@Duke1981Role; @POWELL1981Physical] indicates extensive membrane disruption.\n\n",
