To alleviate of the effects of soaking injury as a result of the increase in the moisture content of seeds before imbibition is related to the reduced binding energy of water molecules and the appearance of respiratory activity Vertucci & Leopold (1984) [@Vertucci1984Bound]. Slow and controlled hydration is essential as the first step in the reactivation of metabolic processes in the dry seed,leading to germination and growth.\n\nThe measurement of EC could also have a role alongside ageing based vigor tests, like the accelerated ageing and controlled deterioration tests, by giving a measure of viability following ageing in 24 hours in place of a germination test around 15 to 30 days or longer [@THORNTON1990Investigation] in *J. curcas*. Furthermore was reported than the relationship between field emergence and EC turned out to be not only interesting, but useful in practical seed technology [@matthews1967detection] as present in these work for *J. curcas*.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nGrateful to the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient´ıfico e Tecnologico (CNPq) for financial support.\n\n",
