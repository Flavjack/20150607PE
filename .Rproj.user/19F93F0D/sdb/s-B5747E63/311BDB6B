According to the enterprise the seeds presented 72% viability and they were collected in 2013 and stored around 9% humidity with any pesticide treatment. \n\n## Imbibiton Test\n\nThe seeds was distributed in 52 cups (400 ml) with 28 seed. For each cup Was applied 100 ml deionized water according to the seeds were in contact with the water. The imbibition treatment correspond from 0 to 24 hours every 2 hours (13 treatments).\n\n## Seed water relation\n\npH and electrical conductivity After each treatment, solution were collected to evaluated pH (W3B, Bel Engineering , Italy) and EC (CD-4306, Lutron, Taiwan) both measurements were made with 20 ml of soaking solution. Seed water content 52 cups (100 ml) was applied 50 ml deionized water and were added 10 seed previously weight in a analytic scale (ATY224, Shimadzu, Japan) according to different imbibition time. After each treatment was take the imbibition weight and putted in papers bags for oven (104 ◦C for 24 hours) for determinate dry weight. As water relation variables were calculated according the following formulas.\n\n\n## Germination Test\n\nThe 52 aluminium trays (1000 ml) were made 9 holes each one. The 25 seed remained was sowing in aluminium trays content 1000 g of river sand imbibed at field capacity (1300 g) after the seed was distributed in the tray and covered with 200 g sand and They were taken to the greenhouse with 27.48 ◦C mean temperature and 78.05% relative humidity. Seedgermination was evaluated daily according to agronomic criteria consider germinated seed when the radicle had emerged about 1 cm above the surface of sowing media. When no germination was observed in all treatments at least in five consecutive days, the germination was considered completed [@Moncaleano2013Germination]. Seed germination was recorded and quantified as germination percentage and evaluate the mean germination time [@czabator1962germination] in Germinaquant Software [@R-GerminaR].\n\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nThe experimental was management in a completely randomized design with thirteen imbibition times and four replications. The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means were compared and segregated by the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p < 0,05), when significance was detected. The numeric variables were subjected a Pearson Correlation Analysis. All the tests were performed using agricolae package [@R-agricolae] from R. The graphics were design under R statistical software [@R-base].\n\n",
