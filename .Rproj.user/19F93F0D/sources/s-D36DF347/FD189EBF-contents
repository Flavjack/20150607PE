# Conclusions

The initial seed water content in *J. curcas* seed should be consider because It will be alter the response of the seed at the imbibition time and will be reflected in the germination variables. To alleviate of the effects of soaking injury as a result of the increase in the moisture content of seeds before imbibition is related to the reduced binding energy of water molecules and the appearance of respiratory activity Vertucci & Leopold (1984) [@Vertucci1984Bound]. Slow and controlled hydration is essential as the first step in the reactivation of metabolic processes in the dry seed,leading to germination and growth.

The measurement of EC could also have a role alongside ageing based vigor tests, like the accelerated ageing and controlled deterioration tests, by giving a measure of viability following ageing in 24 hours in place of a germination test around 15 to 30 days or longer [@THORNTON1990Investigation] in *J. curcas*. Furthermore was reported than the relationship between field emergence and EC turned out to be not only interesting, but useful in practical seed technology [@matthews1967detection] as present in these work for *J. curcas*.
