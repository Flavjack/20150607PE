# Introduction

*Jatropha curcas* L. belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to the American tropics [@Abhilash_2010]. It is a small tree but it can reach 6 meters or more. *J. curcas* is a seed-bearing plant and can produce 1-2 kg of seed per plant/year when the plant is 2-3 years old [@Mukherjee2011Jatropha] and can be propagated both by seeds and stem cuttings.

More than 95% of the oil produced for biodiesel purposes comes from edible oils, which can have a negative impact on food production [@khan_2014]. *J. curcas* seeds are a good source of oil and It has great economic potential as an alternative to oil bio fuel. The decorticated seeds contain 40-60% oil [@Kumar2010Physiological; @SHAH2005Extraction] and is a non-edible, eco-friendly, non-toxic, biodegradable fuel-producing plant has attracted worldwide attention as an alternate sustainable energy source for the future [@Mukherjee2011Jatropha]. 

The seeds of *J. curcas* have a short viability period and they are more sensitive to salinity at germination [@elhag2014effect; @Moncaleano2013Germination]. *J. curcas* is drought tolerant [@da_Luz_Costa_2015] and perhaps also as salinity tolerant it can be cultivated on marginal and salt affected areas, without competing with crop food production  [@elhag2014effect; @heller1996physic]. Seed deterioration is a natural and irreversible process, even under ideal storage conditions. Dry seeds suffer a variety of biochemical and metabolic changes, including lipid peroxidation, enzyme inactivation and rupture of cellular membranes [@Bewley_2012].

In arid environments, the water needed for germination is available for only short periods and consequently, successful crop establishment depends not only on rapid and uniform germination of the seed, but also on the ability of the seed to germinate under low water availability [@Windauer2007Hydrotime]. The speed and uniformity of seed germination are prominent parameters especially for field crop seeds to compete with weed seeds [@Ruttanaruangboworn_2017]. Water uptake is the fundamental requirement for the initiation and completion of seed germination [@Koornneef2002Seed]. Studies on germination and seedling establishment which are the critical stages in the plant life cycle. In these important species have not been conducted so far. Knowledge of the capacity of the species to complete this stage successfully is fundamental for crop production [@Windauer2011Germination]. Considerable variation was registered in *J. curcas* for seed germination, seedling growth and biomass parameters. The small value of error or environmental variances of the seedling growth traits suggests that majority of characters are under genetic control [@ginwal2005seed].

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of *J. curcas* seeds under different imbibition time, seed water relation and aspects about germination.
