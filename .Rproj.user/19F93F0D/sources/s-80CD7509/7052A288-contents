The water content in seeds with impermeable seed coats has important implications for germination, because impermeable coats prevent germination until environmental conditions promote water absorption by seeds followed by germination [@Kestring_2009; @Ribeiro_2015]. This study found a reduction in the seed germination of *J. curcas*, according to seed water imbibition. It is supposed that seeds need a small amount of water for promote the germination because the water imbibition had linearly decrease the germinability and increase its mean germination time, two parameters related to the seed vigor. This phenomena was previously reported in other species, like corn [@Matthews_2006], rice [@Ruttanaruangboworn_2017] castor oil [@Ribeiro_2015] and *Astrophytum* species [@S_nchez_Salas_2012]; however, in contrast of *Mimosa bimucronata* [@Kestring_2009] a floodplain species, where the water uptake sharply increases the seed germination. Also, it was observed during the time line of the experiment there was an increase in EC that reflect in lost the seed germinability from seed steeping in water from 2 to 24 hours.

The seeds used in this experiment were stored in dry environments and hence had very low levels of metabolism. We argue that, during seed imbibition, they swell and metabolic activity increases. Hydration of tissue components during imbibition takes place in a not controlled way so that the reconstruction of internal structures of the cells and organelles were affected. So, leakage of stored components and enzymes, colouring, cracking or absence of cotyledons, and overall damage to the hypocotyl may occur during germination [@Hobbs1972Interaction; @pollock1969vigor]. The amount of the constituents of the leaked depended unequivocally on the initial water content of seeds; the lower moisture in seed at the initial water content show more leakage occurring in seeds with low water contents, below 10% in soybeans seeds [@ISHIDA1988Analysis]. This damage takes place in the early stages of imbibition [@Parrish1977Transient]. This indicates that membrane functions are restored, even though the activities of respiration and metabolism are restricted. Water molecules are semi-bound and mobile water necessary for metabolism is deficient for moisture contents between 12-24% [@Koizumi2008Role]. According to these, the loss of viability can be explained base on the initial seed water content of the seeds used in the experiment because they had an initial moisture around 8%, that is low value compared with the moisture at harvest that is around 18% [@Pompelli_2010]; a possible explanation could be the lost of water by storage condition of the seed for the experiment. In other crops like soybean seeds, water content is usually 10 to 20% at harvest and falls further during storage, seed water contents below 10% were shown to be desirable for long period storage because seeds stop their biological activities and the stored materials are consumed at a minimum level [@Windauer2007Hydrotime]. *J. curcas* seeds after 24 hour of imbibition increases  6.5 times its initial moisture as reported in soybean seeds [@ISHIDA1988Analysis]. Dried seeds can raise their water content to a certain level, two or three times the dry weight, and this rapid increase of water is often accompanied by some deterioration of the tissues, called imbibitional damage. This damage is expressed as a reduced rate of germination and reduced yield of surviving plants [@ISHIDA1988Analysis]. It can be the reason in decrease in the germination percentage in this research. It was reported that soybean seeds with the water content below 13% suffered seriously from imbibitional damage while those above 17% did not, where respiration and metabolic activity rapidly increase with the increase of moisture content [@ISHIDA1988Analysis; @Vertucci1984Bound]. Imbibition damage results from the rapid entry of water into the cotyledons during imbibition, leading to cell death and high solute leakage from the seeds [@POWELL1986Role] and the extensive loss of cellular material and enzymes from the seeds [@Duke1981Role; @POWELL1981Physical] indicates extensive membrane disruption. The electrical conductivity was related to seed water content and the germination for this reason EC tests has been applied to detect vigor differences in many other grain legumes and indeed some other species [@hampton1995handbook; @Moncaleano2013Germination]. The conductivity will increase as the laboratory germination falls, in addition to the reduced ability of germination seeds to retain cell contents [@Matthews_2006]. Reports on pea lots, the EC readings for lots have been found to relate significantly to field emergence [@POWELL1981Physical; @THORNTON1990Investigation].

To alleviate the effects of imbibition damage as a result of the increase in the water content of seeds, a slow and controlled hydration is essential as the first step in the reactivation of metabolic processes in dry seed [@Vertucci1984Bound] leading an increase in the germination and growth ability. The EC vigor test would be developed and standardized for these species [@Abdullah1991Association; @powell1986cell; @Yaklich1979Evaluation]. Furthermore, it was reported than the relationship between field emergence and EC turned out to be not only interesting, but useful in practical seed technology [@matthews2006electrical] as present in these work for *J. curcas*.
