# Conclusions

The initial water content in *J. curcas* seeds should be consider at germination because it will alter seed germinability according to the imbibition time. The EC measurement could have a role such us ageing based vigor test or controlled deterioration test, by giving a measure of viability in 24 hours in place of a normal germination test that takes around 15 days or longer in *J. curcas*.
