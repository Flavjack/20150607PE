## Electrical conductivity and pH

The water solution from the soaked seeds show variation under the imbibiton time  for electrical conductivity (EC) and pH, Figure \@ref(fig:swr) A-B. The pH  range had a variation from 7.7 to 5.13 showing difference between the differents imbibition time with a reduction of the pH in the time (r = -0.88, p<0.05), Figure \@ref(fig:swr)  A. While the EC show a increase in relation to imbibition time (r = 0.80, p<0.05) with value ranges from 0.021 to 0.69 ds.m^−1^, Figure \@ref(fig:swr) B. According the correlation analisys exits a negative correlation between EC and pH (r = -0.74, p<0.05).

## Seed water relation

The seed moisture was 7.93% at the begginig of the experiment and during the time line it arrive until 9.50% , Figure \@ref(fig:swr) C. The seed moisture show a strong positive correlation with the imbibition time (r = 0.89, p<0.05). While the seed water content show a fast increse until the first two hour of imbibition the seed arrives to 25.67% of water content, afterwards these moment the water content in the seeds increase continuously to arrive around 59.23% in 24 hours, Figure \@ref(fig:swr) D. There was an increase in the water content around 6.5 times from initial moisture it is represented for a high correlation between imbibition time with the water content (r = 0.93, p<0.05). While the correlation between both variables is 0.96 (p<0.05). 


## Seed germination analisys

Germinability of the seeds of *Jatropha curcas* had a significant decrease since the 2 hours of imbibition with a initial germinability of 85% for seed without imbibition treatment at 00 hours. After that the range of germinability were between 68 to 44% from 02 to 24 hour of imbibition (Figure \@ref(fig:grm) A). Germinability show a strong negative correlation with imbibition time (r = −0.72, p<0.05). 

The mean germination time in seed without imbibiton has a major value with 4.8 day in comparative with the other treatment with values around 5.89 to 7.06 day for germination between 02 to 24 hours of imbibition (Figure \@ref(fig:grm) B). Seed germinability presented a negative strong correlation with a mean germination time (r = −0.88, p<0.05) 


## Multivariate analisys


<!--  but the EC have a strong correlation with the imbition time (r = 0.84∗∗∗),seed germination (r = −0.90∗∗∗), seed water moisture (r = 0,84∗∗∗) and seed water content (r = 0,90∗∗)∗. -->
