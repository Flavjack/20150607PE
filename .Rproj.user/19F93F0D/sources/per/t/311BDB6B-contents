# Materials and Methods

## Plant material

The experiment was carried out with 2 kg of *Jatropha curcas* seeds from commercial plantation from the Atlantic rain forest region (09°28'S; 35°51'W m.a.s.l.). The plantation consisted of plants that were at least 8 years of age, and the spacing between plants was 2 m × 2 m. Fruits of *J. curcas* were randomly collected during the rainy season from 2016. The seeds presented 72% viability and stored as recommended by @Moncaleano2013Germination.

##  Seed imbibiton test and water relation

The seeds was distributed in 52 frasks (400 mL) with 25 seed for each experimental unit in a controlled room chamber at 25°C. For each frask, 100 ml deionized water was applied, according to the imbibition treatment (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 hours). The pH (W3B, Bel Engineering, Italy) and electrical conductivity (CD-4306, Lutron, Taiwan) were evaluated with 20 mL of soaking solution for each imbibition treatment. For seed water content, in 52 frasks (100 mL) 50 mL deionized water was applied and were added 10 seed previously weighted in an analytic scale, according to different imbibition time. After each treatment was take the seeds imbibition weight and putted in papers bags for oven at 105°C for 24 hours and determinate seeds dry weight. The water relation variables were calculated according the following formulas: $SMT(\%) = 1 - (S_{dw}/S_{fw})*100$ and $SWC(\%) = (S_{tw} - S_{fw})/S_{fw} *100$. Where $SMT(\%)$, Seed moisture; $SWC(\%)$ Seed Water content; $S_{dw} (g)$, Seed dry weight; $S_{fw} (g)$, Seed fresh weight and $S_{tw} (g)$, Seed turgid weight.

## Germination test

For each treatment 25 seeds was sowing in polyethylene trays content 1000 g of river sand at field capacity. The seeds were distributed in the tray and covered with 200 g sand. The germination experiment was carried out in greenhouse condition with average temperature of 27.5°C and 78% relative humidity. Seed germination was evaluated daily according to agronomic criteria consider germinated seed when the radicle had emerged about 1 cm above the soil surface. When no germination was observed in all treatments at least in five consecutive days, the germination was considered completed [@Moncaleano2013Germination].

## Data analysis

The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with 13 treatments of imbibition times (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 hours) with four replications with seeds of *J. curcas*. Statistical analysis were performed in the statistical software R [@R-base]. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the differences between the factors and the comparison of the means with the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p <0.05) [@R-agricolae]. The germination variables and graphs were performed according the GerminaR R package [@R-GerminaR]. For the multivariate analysis, correlation analysis [@R-agricolae; @R-corrplot] and principal component analysis were conducted [@R-FactoMineR].
