# Conclusions

The initial water content in *J. curcas* seeds should be consider because It will be alter the seed germinability according to the imbibition time.  The measurement of EC could be have a role alongside ageing based vigor tests, like the accelerated ageing and controlled deterioration tests, by giving a measure of viability following ageing in 24 hours in place of a germination test around 15 to 30 days or longer in *J. curcas*.
